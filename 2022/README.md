# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

I wrote solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) using Python in December 2022. Over the next six months, I went back through the problems using Java as a way to make myself learn to read and write Java. So far I've only uploaded the Java solutions, as the Python code is often messy and still contains whatever false steps I made.

Some of my Java solutions are an improvement to how I originally solved the problem, and are inspired by posts from the [AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

In parallel I worked through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which served as an excellent tutorial for learning Java.
